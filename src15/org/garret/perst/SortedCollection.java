 * Interface of sorted collection.
 * Sorted collections keeps in members in order specified by comparator.

 * The SortedCollection is efficient container of objects for in-memory databases.
 * For databases which size is significatly larger than size of page pool, operation with SortedList
 * can cause trashing and so very bad performance. Unlike other index structures SortedCollection
 * doesn't store values of keys and so search in the collection requires fetching of its members.
